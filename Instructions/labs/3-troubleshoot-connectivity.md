# Module 03: Troubleshoot cloud and hybrid connectivity in Microsoft Azure

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you find yourself managing a complex Azure network topology comprising three Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) organized in a hub-and-spoke configuration. Your primary goal is to enable communication between VM1 and VM2 via VnetHub. However, users have reported that VM1 cannot establish communication with VM2, and your task is to diagnose and rectify the problem.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab you will perform:

+ Task 1: Verify the network topology
+ Task 2: Check OSI level 3 connectivity
+ Task 3: Troubleshoot the problem
+ Task 4: Resolve the connection issue

## Estimated timing: 60 minutes

You've configured your network as shown in the diagram below. You want VM1 and VM2 to communicate via the VnetHub. Users are complaining that VM1 cannot communicate with VM2. You need to investigate to diagnose the problem and then fix it.

There are three Azure virtual networks (VNets) in a hub and spoke topology.

## Task 1: Verify the network topology

1.  If you are not logged in already, click on Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials or skip to **step 2**.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. From the portal menu on the top left, select **Resource groups**.

   ![Screenshot of the resource visualizer showing the Vnet resources.](../media/mod3-rg.png)

1. Select **lab03-rg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**.

    ![Screenshot of the resource visualizer showing the Vnet resources.](../media/rg.png)

1. Select **Resource visualizer**.

   ![Screenshot of the resource visualizer showing the Vnet resources.](../media/mod3-rv1.png)

1. Check the private IP addresses of the firewall (**FW1**) and virtual machines (**VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />** and **VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**). These are allocated automatically.

### Task 2: Check OSI level 3 connectivity

1. Connect to each virtual machines (****VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**** and ****VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />****) using Bastion.

2. Select the portal menu on the top left, select **Virtual machines**.

3. Search for **vm1 (1)** under virtual machines blade and select **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> (2)** under lab03-rg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />.

    ![Screenshot showing selecting option 15.](../media/vm.png)

4. On the **Overview** pane, select **Connect**, then select **Bastion**.

5. Under **Connection Settings**, enter the following details and click on **Connect (3)**, a new tab in your browser should connect to **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**
 
   Username: `AdminXyz` (1).
     
   Password: `Azur$Pa55w0rd` (2).

  ![Screenshot showing selecting option 15.](../media/mod3-vm1bastion.png)
    
  **Note** Please ensure to enable the pop up settings of the browser.
    
  ![Screenshot showing selecting option 15.](../media/popup.png)
    
6. After you've connected to the machine, in the SConfig menu, enter option **15**.

   ![Screenshot showing the ping output for the firewall and VM2.](../media/mod3-sconfig.png)

7. Ping the private IP address of the Azure firewall (**FW1**).

    ```powershell
    ping 10.1.1.4
    ```

8. On **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**, in the command prompt window ping the private IP address of **VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**.

    ```powershell
    ping 10.3.1.4
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing the ping output for the firewall and VM2.](../media/mod3-vm1-ping-test.png)

The firewall is reachable from **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />** and **VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />** is not    reachable.

9. Now, switch back to Azure portal and on the breadcrumb trail select **virtual machines**, repeat the above steps to select the **VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />** and connect with Bastion.

    ![Screenshot showing the ping output for the firewall and VM2.](../media/mod3-vm.png)

10. Use these Windows credentials:

    - Username: **AdminXyz**
    
    - Password: **Azur$Pa55w0rd**

11. After you've connected to the machine, in the SConfig menu, enter option **15**.

12. Ping the private IP address of the Azure firewall (**FW1**).

    ```powershell
    ping 10.1.1.4
    ```

13. Ping the private IP address of **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**.

    ```powershell
    ping 10.2.1.4
    ```

    ![Screenshot showing the ping output for the firewall and VM1.](../media/mod3-vm2-ping-test.png)

    On VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> both the firewall and VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> are reachable.

### Task 3: Troubleshoot the problem

1. To understand what is causing the problem, try the following troubleshooting steps:

1. Examine **ipconfig /all** on both **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />** and **VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />**.

1. Examine the Network Security Groups, and routing tables.

1. Examine the firewall and the firewall rules.

1. Examine the peering connection properties.

    The diagram shows the effective routes on **VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> nic**.

    ![Screenshot showing the effective routes.](../media/mod3-nic.png)

## Task 4: Resolve the connection issue

When you examined the peering connections, you find that the peering settings are different.

| **VNet**| **Peering name**| **Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network**|
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| VnetHub| Hub-Spoke1| Allow (default)|
| VnetHub| Hub-Spoke2| Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network|
| VnetSpoke1| Spoke1-Hub| Allow (default)|
| VnetSpoke2| Spoke2-Hub| Block traffic that originates from outside this virtual network|

1.In the azure portal navigate to virtual networks and select VnetHub and click on **Peerings** under settings tab

![Screenshot showing peerings.](../media/vnet.png)

Under peerings select hub spoke 2.

![Screenshot showing peerings.](../media/hub.png)

The settings on **Hub-Spoke2** are incorrect.

![Screenshot showing the incorrect spoke traffic forwarding setting.](../media/6-incorrect-traffic-forwarding.png)

To fix the problem, you must change the setting on both sides of the peering between VnetHub and VnetSpoke2.

- Hub-Spoke2

To enable the traffic from spoke 2-virtual networks-select VnetSpoke2-peerings-enable allow traffic from remote virtual network.

![Screenshot showing peerings.](../media/vnetspoke2.png)


The **Traffic forwarded from remote virtual network** must be set to **Allow**. There will be a short delay before the new settings take effect. If the ping fails at first, try again.

![Screenshot showing the command prompt with the ping request working.](../media/mod3-vm1-ping-fixed.png)

It's now possible to ping VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> from VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />.
