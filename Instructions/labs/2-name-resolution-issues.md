# Module 02: Troubleshoot name resolution issues in Microsoft Azure

## Lab Scenario

You work as a network engineer for Contoso, a company that relies on Microsoft Azure for its infrastructure. Users have reported issues accessing VM1 and VM2. Contoso's Azure environment consists of two virtual networks, VNet1 and VNet2, interconnected via peering. Your role as a network engineer is to diagnose and resolve these network-related problems to ensure seamless communication between VM1, VM2, and VM3. The tasks in this lab guide you through the troubleshooting process, from diagnosing networking issues to examining the IP configuration, testing network connectivity, and resolving any DNS-related problems.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab you will perform:

+ Task 1: Diagnose networking issues between virtual machines
+ Task 2: Examine the Internet Protocol configuration of the Virtual Machines
+ Task 3: Test network connectivity
+ Task 4: Examine the Azure resource group
+ Task 5: Resolve the connection issue
+ Task 6: Inspect the Domain Name System name table

### Estimated timing: 60 minutes

You work for Contoso as a network engineer, and users are complaining that they cannot access VM1 or VM2. You have configured two Azure virtual networks: VNet1 and VNet2. They are connected with peering.

### Task 2: Examine the Internet Protocol configuration of the Virtual Machines

The internal IP addresses of the virtual machines are:

- VM1 = 10.1.1.4

- VM2 = 10.1.2.4

- VM3 = 10.2.0.4

The DNS server address is 168.63.129.16, which is the wire server.

![Screenshot of command prompt results after running i p config / all." lightbox="../media/5-network-configure.png](../media/mod2-ip.png)

### Task 3: Test network connectivity

Use **ping** to test network connectivity between the three virtual machines. Use the open Bastion tab for virtual machine VM1 try and try to ping the other two machines.

1. In the command window, run this command.

    ```powershell
    ping 10.1.2.4
    ```
1. Run this command.

    ```powershell
    ping 10.2.0.4
    ```

    If you ran these commands on the other machines you'd see that all three VMs are able to ping each other, so network connectivity is good at the IP level (OSI Layer 3).

    ![Screenshot of command screen after pinging for network connectivity." lightbox="../media/5-ping-connectivity.png](../media/mod2-pingconnection.png)

### Task 4: Examine the Azure resource group

There are two virtual networks (VNets) called **VNet1** and **VNet2**.

There is a private DNS zone, which is **contoso.com**.

  ![Screenshot showing the resources within the resource group." lightbox="../media/5-resource-group.png](../media/mod2-venets1.png)

The private DNS zone has VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> and VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> automatically registered, but VM3-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> does not appear.

  ![Screenshot showing that that vm 3 is not appearing." lightbox="../media/5-no-machine-3.png](../media/mod2-contoso.png)

Switch back to the Azure portal tab. 

1. Search for private DNS zones, then select **contoso.com**.

   ![Screenshot showing that that vm 3 is not appearing." lightbox="../media/5-no-machine-3.png](../media/mod2-contoso1.png)

1. Under **Settings**, select **Virtual network links**.

    ![Screenshot showing the virtual links." lightbox="../media/5-virtual-network.png](../media/mod2-vnetlink1.png)

    Note that the private DNS zone is linked to **VNet1**, but not to **VNet2**.

### Task 5: Resolve the connection issue

Your investigation points to a configuration issue with the private DNS zone.

### Link the private Domain Name System zone to Virtual Network 2

1. On the Virtual network links pane, select **+ Add** and enter these details:

    - Link name: **vnet2_dns (1)**
    
    - [ ] I know the resource ID of virtual network â€“ leave unchecked (2)
    
    - Subscription: &lt;Select the name of your subscription&gt; (3)
    
    - Virtual network: VNet2 (lab02-rg-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> 4))
    
    - Configuration: [&#10003;] Enable auto registration (5)
   
      Select **OK (6)**.
      
      ![Screenshot showing the d n s table." lightbox="../media/5-table.png](../media/mod2-vnet2.png)

    >**Note**: It may take a few minutes for the link to be created. Select Refresh occasionally to see the latest status. Wait until the link status says Completed.

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:

### Task 6: Inspect the Domain Name System name table

1. Navigate to the Overview page and inspect the DNS name table.

VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />, VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />, and VM3-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> should appear. You may need to wait a short while for VM3 to appear. Select Refresh if necessary.

Nslookup on VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> and VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> should resolve VM3-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />.contoso.com.

>**Note**: If VM3-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" /> does not appear after several minutes, try restarting the VM.

  ![Screenshot showing the d n s table." lightbox="../media/5-table.png](../media/mod2-vm3dns.png)

1. Switch back to the VM1 tab in your browser. 

1. Run this powershell command:

    ```powershell
    nslookup  VM1-DID.contoso.com
    ```

1. Run this powershell command:

    ```powershell
    nslookup  VM2-DID.contoso.com
    ```

1. Run this powershell command:

    ```powershell
    nslookup  VM3-DID.contoso.com
    ```
    
    >**Note**: Replace **DID** with the Deployment Id from your Environment details page.

   ![Screenshot showing the results of running the n s lookup commands." lightbox="../media/5-command-prompt-machine.png](../media/mod2-powershellcommands2.png)

Optionally, you can test pinging each VM, using their DNS names.

- `ping  VM1-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />.contoso.com`

- `ping  VM2-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />.contoso.com`

- `ping  VM3-<inject key="Deployment ID" enableCopy="false" />.contoso.com`

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
