# Module 05: Troubleshoot virtual machine connections

## Lab Scenario

In this lab, you are working as a support engineer responsible for Azure infrastructure. The web team in your organization has reported an issue with the website not responding. They have a pool of web servers behind a load balancer and a public IP address that should allow users to access the website. Your task is to troubleshoot the connectivity issues and resolve them.

## Lab Objectives

In this lab you will perform:

+ Task 01: Verify that the website can't be reached
+ Task 02: Check that Network Security Groups are configured correctly
+ Task 03: Check the network settings for the virtual machines
+ Task 04: Check the load balancer
+ Task 05: Use the Diagnose and solve problems troubleshooter
+ Task 06: Validate load balancer rules


## Estimated timing: 30 minutes

You work as a support engineer supporting Azure infrastructure. You've been contacted by your web team about an issue with the website not responding. The web team have a pool of webservers behind a load balancer and public IP address.

In this lab, you'll use what you've learned to go through steps to troubleshoot the connection issues to the virtual machines.

### Task 01: Verify that the website can't be reached

1.  If you are not logged in already, click on Azure portal shortcut that is available on the desktop and log in with below Azure credentials or skip to **step 2**.
    * Azure Username/Email: <inject key="AzureAdUserEmail"></inject> 
    * Azure Password: <inject key="AzureAdUserPassword"></inject>

1. From the portal open the **Cloud shell (1)**, use this Azure CLI command in the Cloud Shell to get the public IP address of the scale set.

2. Select **Bash** and if there is any pop-up to create storage, follow the below steps.

   ![](../media/Az-720-bash.png)

3. Click on **Show advanced settings** and then provide the following details and click **Create Storage**

    ![](../media/az720-5-6-cli.png)

   * Resource group : Select **Use existing** -> **lab05-rg-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
   * Storage account : Select **Create new** and Enter **cloudstore<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**
   * File Share: Select **Create new** and Enter **blob**

> **Note :** Please wait until the storage account is created and proceed with step4.

4. In the cloud shell run this command:

    ```
    az network public-ip show \
    --resource-group lab05-rg-$DID \
    --name webPublicIP \
    --query '[ipAddress]' \
    --output tsv
    ```
    >**Note**: Replace $DID with the Deployment Id from your Environment details page.

5. Copy the IP address, in a new tab in your browser, try to navigate to it.

    >**Note**: Your IP address will be different to the one in the above screenshot.

    > - Navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
    > - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. You can proceed to the next task if you receive a success message.
    > - If not, carefully read the error message and retry the step, following the instructions in the lab guide.
    > - If you need any assistance, please contact us at labs-support@spektrasystems.com. We are available 24/7 to help you out.

### Task 02: Check that Network Security Groups are configured correctly

1. In the Azure portal search for **Network security groups**.

   ![A screenshot showing the NSG entered in portal](../media/Az-720-5-3.png)

1. Under **Services**, select **Network Security Groups**.

    ![A screenshot showing the required NSG to select](../media/az-720-5-2-2.png)

1. Select **webNetworkSecurityGroup**.

1. Check that internet traffic over port **80** is allowed by the Network Security Group.

    ![Screenshot of the Network Security Group inbound rules are correct.](../media/Az-720-5-5.png)

### Task 03: Check the network settings for the virtual machines

1. Go to Resource Groups and select **lab05-rg-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

1. Select **WebVM1-labrg05-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>**

   ![A screenshot showing the required VM to select](../media/Az-720-5-6.png)

1. On the left, under **Settings**, select **Networking**.

1. Note that port 80 is allowed.

   ![A screenshot showing the required port is allowed](../media/Az-720-5-7n1.png)

1. Repeat these steps for **WebVM2-labrg05-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/>** virtual machine.

### Task 04: Check the load balancer

1. In the Azure portal, search for **Load balancers**, then under **Services**, select **Load balancers**.

    ![Screenshot showing searching for load balancers.](../media/Az-720-5-7n.png)

1. Select the **webLoadBalancer**.

1. On the left, under **Settings**, select **Frontend IP configuration**.

   ![A screenshot showing  the frontend IP address highlighted.](../media/Az-720-5-8.png)

1. Check that there is a frontend IP address, and that this is the IP you tested at the beginning of this exercise.

1. On the left, under **Settings**, select **Load balancing rules**.

   ![Screen shot showing the load balancing rules.](../media/Az-720-5-9.png)

   >**Note**:
   > There is a rule for port **80** and port **443**

### Task 05: Use the Diagnose and solve problems troubleshooter

1. On the left, select **Diagnose and solve problems**.

1. Select the **No connectivity to the backend pool** troubleshooter.

   ![A screenshot showing the No connectivity to backend pool troubleshooter.](../media/Az-720-5-10.png)

1. In the **Tell us more about the problem you are experiencing** drop-down box, select **Intermittent connectivity**.

1. Scroll down and read the insight found.

    ![Screen shot of the connectivity results showing the backend pool can't be connected to over port 443.](../media/Az-720-5-11.png)
    
    >**Note**: Wait for 3-5 min to display the output as shown in above screenshot. 

    The insight points to the fact that the backend instances in the pool aren't listening for port **443**. The website instances should be listening to port **80**. This insight points to a problem in the load balancer rule.

## Part B - Resolve the connection issue

After investigating the connection issues to your website, you've found an issue with the load balancer rule user by the virtual machine scale set. You'll now resolve the issue and check that the website can be accessed.

### Task 06: Validate load balancer rules

1. In the Azure portal, search for **load balancers**, and then under **Services**, select **Load balancers**.

   ![A screenshot showing searching for load balancers." lightbox="../media/7-load-balancers.png](../media/Az-720-5-7n.png)

1. Select the **webLoadBalancer** load balancer.

1. Under **Settings**, select **Load balancing rules**.

   ![A screenshot showing the load balancer rule highlighted." lightbox="../media/6-load-balancing-rules.png](../media/Az-720-5-12.png)

1. From the list of rules, select **webLoadBalancerRule**.

   ![A screenshot of the load balancer rule, showing the port set to 80 and backend port set to 443. This is the error." lightbox="../media/7-my-load-balancer-rule-web.png](../media/Az-720-5-13.png)

1. To resolve the backend issue, change the **Backend port** from **443** to **80**, and then select **Save**.

    >**Note**: The front and backend port number in this environment need to be the same to get a response from the webserver to http requests.

1. Wait until the rule has been deployed successfully.

    > **Congratulations** on completing the task! Now, it's time to validate it. Here are the steps:
    > - Navigate to the Lab Validation Page, from the upper right corner in the lab guide section.
    > - Hit the Validate button for the corresponding task. You can proceed to the next task if you receive a success message.

### Verify that the website can now be reached

1. Refresh the tab you opened to test the public IP address.

    >**Note**:
    > If you have closed the previous browser tab, run this command to get the public IP address.
    >
    > ```
    > az network public-ip show \
    > --resource-group lab05-rg-$DID \
    > --name webPublicIP \
    > --query '[ipAddress]' \
    > --output tsv
    > ```
    >**Note**:Replace $DID Value from the DeploymentID from the Environment Details page.

    If the website is online, you'll see a page with a **Hello World** message from the backend instance.
